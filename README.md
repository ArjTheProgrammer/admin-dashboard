## Description

This project is part of "The Odin Project" Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The task was to build a full dashboard design using CSS Grid. I created an admin dashboard layout, incorporating various elements like the sidebar, header, and main content containers. The dashboard is designed with a BINI theme, and it includes HTML and CSS concepts related to backgrounds, forms, inputs, and validations.

## Features

1. **Background Image**: Utilize a captivating background image that aligns with the BINI theme.
2. **Logo Section**: Display the BINI logo.
3. **Sidebar Navigation**: Implement navigation links in the sidebar.
4. **Header Elements**: Include a search bar, user info, and buttons.
5. **Main Content**: Use grids to lay out projects, announcements, and trending items.
